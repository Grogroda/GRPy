# GRPy

This is a small project developed by a small group of physics graduate students at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), where we want to put our understanding of general relativity and computation to the test to develop a simple Python module to make calculations related to general relativity, and since we are still not sure where we can/want to get, there's not much to write here (for now).
